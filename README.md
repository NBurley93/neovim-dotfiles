# Cabal's Neovim Dotfiles

## Setup

Ensure you are connected to the internet,
startup nvim and Lazy should automatically bootstrap and install. After that, you can run `:Lazy sync` to update plugins if needed.

This configuration is following a cutting-edge approach and follows the head of master as much as possible for plugins, so frequent breaking changes will be expected.

Make sure to use checkhealth to determine what needs to be either installed natively, or installed using Mason. LSP & Linting/Formatting require a few, so check the config to figure out which or just run checkhealth
